# Model Notes
This is a kinetic model of the monomeric photosystem II (PSII).  
The model is partially based on the earlier model used for simulation of the
flash-induced period-four damped oscillation of oxygen evolution and
chlorophyll fluorescence (Jablonsky J and Lazar D (2008) Biophys J, 94:
2725-2736 pubmedID: [18178650](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178650) ).
For short description of reactions and initial concentrations, see the notes
in the model file. For explanation of the value of the rate constants, see:
Lazar D (2003) J. theor. Biol. 220:469-503 pubmedID:
[12623282](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12623282) ; Jablonsky J and
Lazar D, 2008 Biophys J, 94: 2725-2736 pubmedID:
[18178650](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178650) and Jablonsky, Susila
and Lazar, 2008, DOI: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btn530](http://dx.doi.org/10.109
3/bioinformatics/btn530) pubmedID:
[18845578](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18845578) ).  
The oxygen signal in the model is defined as a maximum of the sum of
concentrations of the model forms in the iS3Yp-state (handled in MATLAB). This
version of model cannot be used for simulation of the chlorophyll fluorescence
because for simplicity the reactions behind the loss of excited state are not
considered.  
The meaning of the particular letters in the model is as follows: P – P680
(special chlorophyll pair), H – pheophytin, A – QA (the first quinone electron
acceptor), B – QB (the second quinone electron acceptor), PQ – oxidized
plastoquinone molecules in the PQ pool, PQH – reduced and protonated PQ
molecules in the PQ pool, Y/Yp – reduced/oxidized state of tyrosine 161-D1,
YD/YDox – reduced/oxidized state of tyrosine 160-D2, Sn (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) – the
S-states of oxygen evolving complex (OEC), iSn (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) – the
intermediate S-states of OEC.  
All reactions describing electron transport through PSII entered into the
model are assumed to be first order reactions with respect to one reactant and
are defined as mass action reactions. This approach enables to consider
D1-Y161 (YZ) and oxygen evolving complex (OEC) as the integral parts of the
PSII, in contrary of the multi-units PSII model (Jablonsky and Lazar, 2008,
Biophys J, 94: 2725-2736 pubmedID:
[18178650](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18178650) ) or model of dimeric
PSII (Jablonsky, Susila and Lazar, 2008, DOI: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn530).
